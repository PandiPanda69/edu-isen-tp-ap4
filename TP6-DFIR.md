# TP6 - Digital Forensics & Incident Response

_Sébastien Mériot ([@smeriot](https://twitter.com/smeriot))_

Durée: 4 hours

Setup The Environment
=====================

This exercice won't rely on [MI-LXC](https://github.com/flesueur/mi-lxc). But before starting, make sure you have the following
requirements:
- A software to read `pcap` files (`tcpdump`, _Wireshark_, ... note that _Wireshark_ is strongly recommanded) ;
- A text editor
- A spreadsheet editor (Excel, Open Office, ...)
- What you learnt during the module ;

This exercise expects a group of 4 students to send a report explaining how you got the result. Do not lose any minute, you have to
send the report at the end of the allocated time. The best strategy is to split the work to address simultaneously both *Forensics*
and *Action Plan* parts.

Good luck & have fun.

Timing
======

In order to help you manage your time, a duration estimation is given for each subpart.

Scenario
========

You are a consultant working in a commercial CERT (_Computer Emergency Response Team_). Your company has been requested by the "Target"
company after they discovered a strange behavior on the laptop of the system administrator. They don't have much more information yet.

Your mission is to make the security incident response in order to:
- Investigate and determine how the company "Target" got compromised ;
- Try to understand what was the goal of the adversary and what has been done ;
- Recover materials that may help identify who is the adversary ;
- Analyze the configuration in place during the attack and propose an action plan to improve the resiliency of the "Target" company
  regarding such attacks.
  
__You are a security expert. As you may know, you should NEVER execute any unknown binary on your computer.__
  
Investigations
==============

_Estimated Duration: 3 hours_

By chance, a network capture is available. The system administrator forgot he has a terminal open with a running `tcpdump` on his
laptop for days.
Another analyst in your team has isolated 500 packets that seems to be interesting and your skills are now required to analyze the
content of the capture. This is the only exploitable trace. The file is using the pcap format and it can be downloaded
[here](https://github.com/PandiPanda69/edu-insa-srs/raw/main/capture.pcap).

The technical team of the "Target" company provided you the network architecture to help you investigate the packet capture.
The packet capture has been done on the system administrator laptop.

> In order to help analyze the capture, you can apply a filter to hide packets that are not relevant. Here is an example that could
> help reduce the amount of packets to analyze by removing both ARP and IPv6: `!arp && ip.version == 4`. 
> Feel free to use filters to help you to find what you are looking for. You can easily filter on protocols, i.e. HTTP protocol with
> `!arp && ip.version == 4 && http` or `!arp && ip.version == 4 && dns` for DNS.
> You can also use the "Follow" feature (right click in the graphical interface on a packet) to have all the related communications
> reassembled in a single window.

> TCP packet type reminder:
> - The _3-way handshake_ established a connection (`SYN`,  `SYNACK`, `ACK`).
> - Data are pushed with `PSH` packets and an acknowledgement `ACK` is sent each time it has been properly received.
> - Connection ends when a `FIN` packet is received or, in case of an issue, when received a `RST` packet.

> __To answer the questions, note all the involved IPs, URLs, passwords and what could become an indicator of compromise afterwards.__

> [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding is a way to encode data. It is often used in order to obfuscate code and

Action Plan
===========

_Estimated Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes_

In order to avoid the "Target" company facing the same situation, you also have to provide recommandations about how the company can
improve its security. To build the action plan, all your cybersecurity knowledge are required as well as the results of the forensics.
A quick audit of the security of the company can also be helpful.

You can download a [zip file](https://github.com/PandiPanda69/edu-insa-srs/raw/main/annexes.zip) containing several `iptables`
configurations found on the network and a quick interview of the system administrator of the "Target" company performed by one of your
colleague.

> The network plan can be found [above](#investigations).

## First Statement (20min)

31. What do you think about the `iptables` configurations ?
32. When reading the interview, make a quick table to sum up the pros & cons. Evaluate the security maturity of the company.

## The Action Plan (70min)

The action plan is going to be presented to the board.

You are going to prepare this action plan with all the actions you think important to improve the company security. You'll have to
present it to the top management of the "Target" company. They would approve or not your plan depending on the relevance of your
proposals and the budget.

The table below shows you a quick example of what is expected (you can adapt it regarding your needs).

| Ref.  | Title                         | Objective                                            | Priority | Complexity | Security Imprvmt | Req. Man Days | Profile       |
| :--:  | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | :-------: | :-------: | :--------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| SEC_R | Rework network architecture   | Imprive the security of the architecture.            | CRITICAL | HIGH       | IMPORTANT        |    N days     | Network expert |
| SEC_X | Deploy a security software    | The tool X is so nice to do security stuff.          | LOW      | LOW        | MEDIUM           |    K days.    | Sys. Admin.   |

33. Make a table of all the actions your think good to (1) trust back the network by cleaning all what need to be cleaned and (2) improve
    the security of the "Target" company with detection capabilities and hardening to avoid this situation happening again. Provide an
    indication of the impact of your measure on the security and how many time is required to implement it. 

34. In taking in consideration the financial elements shown below, make a quick quotation for your action plan (explain your figures).

35. Regroup your actions into batches and schedule how these batches should be implemented. The "Target" top management can then choose
    which batches they want to implement. For each batch, provide financial information.
